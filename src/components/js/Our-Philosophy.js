        <p>
          Our deepest condolences for your loss. <br/>
          During this time, we appreciate the many difficulties and mixed emotions that you and your loved ones
          may be experiencing, and we sympathize with you. We understand that each person’s experience facing
          a loss is different, given the unique relationship they had with that person.
          We recognize that the last worry on one’s mind during this period should be spending the time and
          effort making phone calls and taking meetings in an effort to find the funeral home and services of best
          fit for their needs, as well as facing the uncertainty of expenses. These tasks add to the burden one is
          already carrying at the time of a loved one’s passing.
          Time, money and death are sensitive topics, and the old way of connecting those seeking out funeral
          services and the businesses providing them was suboptimal, adding unnecessary stress to a difficult
          situation. <br/>
          Peacely was conceived out of these very experiences as a means to create a simpler process. Let Peacely
          do the heavy lifting for you.
          In the days to come, you can count on us to work on your behalf to connect you with the service
          provider that best fits your needs. <br/>
